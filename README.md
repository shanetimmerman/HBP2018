# HBP2018

The main intention of this project was to familiarize myself with Spotify's api (never again), learning about 
dynamically updating GUI libraries (expeciall Kivy. God I love that markdown support) in Python, and use them
to develop revamp the full screen mode in the Spotify desktop app. Rather than just filling the space, I wanted
to highlight what I can about seeing, real time lyrics and a major focus on album art, which the mobile apps do
fanastically.
